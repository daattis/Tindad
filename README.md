# Tindad
A webpage (of an imaginary mobile app) "Tindad" using HTML, CSS + Boostrap 4
The idea of the page is to introduce a mobile app to stay-home-dads for networking and helping them arrange get-togethers with their kids. 
The page wasdone along with the online course "The Complete 2021 Web Development Bootcamp" by App Brewery.
